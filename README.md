# CHia Improvement Proposals (CHIPS)

This repository contains a list of improvements related to Chia. The complete procedure for proposing and managing a CHIP can be found in [CHIP 1](/CHIPs/chip-0001.md).

The [CHIPs backlog project](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/projects/1) provides the list of on-going proposals and their status. 

## Meetings 
**Purpose:**

The CHIPS community meetings provide a forum for the community to gather and discuss CHIPS proposals and support each other in building a secure, sustainable, and compliant blockchain technology. 

**Agenda:**

The agenda of each meeting should focus on the CHIPS proposals, and it should include two main topics: 
- Author to present the CHIP
- Feedback and discussion

**Logistics**
- The meeting information will be tracked with GitHub [project](https://github.com/Chia-Network/dev-community-meetings/projects/1). 
- The agenda should be published two weeks before the actual meeting to give the community ample time to suggest agenda items or post questions about the CHIP.
